"""
session-memory :: UserPromptSubmit hook.
Fires on every prompt, before the agent sees it. Two jobs:
  1. Record the prompt into .agent/memory/session/entries.jsonl (secrets
     redacted, best-effort).
  2. Recall entries from *other* sessions that are lexically similar to this
     prompt, and inject them as additional context -- this is what "sits
     between the calls": the agent gets related history automatically,
     without either of you having to remember it exists.

Recalled entries have their `weight` bumped (see memory.py `recall` /
`bump_weight`), a frequency heuristic so entries that keep proving relevant
rank a little higher next time. It is not a trained model and not true
reinforcement learning -- it is a cheap, honest approximation of it.

Wire-up (.claude/settings.json):
  "UserPromptSubmit": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command",
    "command": "python3 .agent/skills/session-memory/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py"}]}]

Never blocks the prompt: any failure here is swallowed and the hook exits 0.
